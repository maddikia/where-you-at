# where-you-at (WIP)
Entry for Mit Blueprint 2020 Hackathon

Where-you-at is an augmented reality web app which encourages people to travel and visit local 'hotspots' by awarding them points and cosmetics for visting and sharing pictures.

# Preamble

In many urban areas in the US, the number of people per day who go outside and appreciate local stores, resturants, museums, and landmarks has signifigantly dropped over the past twenty or so years. We hope to make an app that is able to somewhat alieviate this stress on the physical and mental health of residents. In addition, we hope to bring back money to local arts institutions such as orchestras and museums, which have felt the rise in popularity of online entertainment.

# Overview

The app uses the google maps API to track users and verify that they have reached a 'hotspot'. All players in a given region compete on a leaderboard for cosmetic prizes e.g. new avatars or gui reskins.
